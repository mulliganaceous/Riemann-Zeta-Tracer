# Riemann Zeta tracer

This is a basic Java Swing program which animates the path of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line.
The trailing part of the path is colored red, while the leading part of the path is colored violet.

This is the program that runs for the **Operation: Hashling** livestream, where Discord starts assigning unique usernames to the remaining users who have not updated their usernames themselves.
